# ᎤᏂᎩᏔ/Unikta 🌱

ᎤᏂᎩᏔ/Unikta (\/uːniːkʰtʰɑ/ 'seeds') is a Cherokee font for [Playdate Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/), a tool that lets users create simple videogames and interactive stories without writing any code which can then be played in a web browser, on a computer, or on a [Playdate](https://play.date).

Pulp is easy to use because of its limitations, but these limitations also include only being able to type unaccented letters of the Latin alphabet. ᎤᏂᎩᏔ/Unikta works by replacing the stock glyphs with Cherokee characters, so that while Pulp still sees them as the original alphabetic characters, they display as Cherokee syllabary instead.

Since there's only space for 95 glyphs in a Pulp font and the Cherokee syllabary takes up 85 of those slots, punctuation is limited to the bare minimum — space, comma, period, exclamation mark, question mark, quotes, and a colon — and most of the numbers from 0-9 are rendered by visual equivalents in the syllabary: Ꮻ wi for '0', Ꮽ wu for '9', etc.
