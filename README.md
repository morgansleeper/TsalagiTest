Unikta (\/uːniːkʰtʰɑ/ 'seeds') is a Cherokee font for Playdate Pulp.

You could use Yamanotes for ambience or to reimagine your commute, but it was designed as a companion app to the PS4/Switch game [*電車でGO！！はしろう山手線*](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9B%BB%E8%BB%8A%E3%81%A7GO!#%E9%9B%BB%E8%BB%8A%E3%81%A7GO!!_%E3%81%AF%E3%81%97%E3%82%8D%E3%81%86%E5%B1%B1%E6%89%8B%E7%B7%9A), so players can trigger the missing departure melodies before leaving each station using a phone or tablet. Along with the inner Yamanote loop, you can also trigger melodies from sections of other lines featured in the game - click the 'line' option to see what's available!
